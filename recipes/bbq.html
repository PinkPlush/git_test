    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This seasoning makes any steak awesome. This is the best. It doesn't overpower the steak. I can't eat a steak out anymore because I always compare it to this seasoning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4teaspoons salt, or to taste
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li> ¾ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground coriander, or to taste</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 (16 ounce) t-bone steaks, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the salt, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, coriander, and turmeric together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Rub the steaks on all sides with the seasoning mixture. Cook on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
